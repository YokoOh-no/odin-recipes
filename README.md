First Odin project
    Welcome to my first official coding/web dev/full stack project. I am very excited to take thid first step to changing my career and becoming a full time web developer. 

    In this project I will be demonstrating the html skills i aquired in the firts lesson in the Odin Project. I will try my best to use this project to grade my basic html skills. I would also like to be able to learn a few other skills on my own and then when this project is revisited in the future curicculim i want to be able to see where i was right and where i totally misunderstood. The only fear or downside to this learning approach is that i run the risk of developing bad habits... all that aside... Here we go..!
