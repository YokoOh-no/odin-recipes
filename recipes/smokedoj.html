                        <p>Honestly, just about any Orange juice could work for this recipe. 
                            There has even been times where ive had to make a tequila tini at the 
                            restaurant without it. I just used fresh squeezed orange juice, and it still tastes amazing. </p>       
                                        <p>You want to start by choosing an orange that is ripe. You will also prefer to find an orange that is
                                             slightly over-ripe than one that is under ripe.</p>
                
                
                <ol>
                         <li>Cut orange(s) in half.</li> 
                         <li>Place oranges on grill.</li>      
                        <li>Wait intil orange turns a deep, rich orange/gold, and has well difined grill marks. </li>
                        <li>Juice orange and stain. You will want to strain bwcause the char marks from the grill will get into the juice making it more bitter.</li>
                </ol>
